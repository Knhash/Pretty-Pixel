# Pretty-Pixel

### DESCRIPTION
Your goal is to find a viewpoint where pixels form a picture within minimum time.

This game is all about perspective.

The player is given 2000 points at level 1. Starting a game takes the player to a screen of seemingly random points in space alternately connected by lines. When the mouse is moved, these points also move.

These set of seemingly random points actually make up an image and the aim of the game is to find these images by moving the mouse to rotate the playing field to find the correct position on the screen. When the player reached close to this "Viewpoint", from where the image can be viewed, the points snap into place and the player knows that they have passed.

Left mouse click advances the player to the next level. It also supplies the player with additional 1000 points. The goal is to retain the maximum number of points at the end of
seven levels.

It is important to note that if the score counter reaches 0 before the player finds the Viewpoint, s/he loses.

### EXTRA FEATURES
- A very important feature is the ability to make custom levels. One can create their own level and play it as well.

- The difficulty of the game can also be controlled, which removes the alternate lines and makes the player have to play with only a set of points in space.

- The points can be made to blink in random colors, giving it such an aesthetic look if the player so desires.
